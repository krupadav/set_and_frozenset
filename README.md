# set_and_frozenset
SET
syntax: For emty set:set(), while we supply elements then curly brackets are used {}
It is mutable.
Set doesnt preserve the sequence as the background data structure is hash table. As it doest preserve sequence so indexing and slicing are also not supported.
It accept all value, but duplicates are not allowed.
FROZEN_SET: Syntax is 'frozenset()' It is immutable so no mutable method are accepted. This is the only difference between set and frozenset.
